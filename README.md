# advent-of-code
This repo contains my personal solutions to the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

It was my first year of participating, and I successfully made it through the first 14 days before running out of steam. My motivation for participating was to improve my programming skills, learn some new algorithms, and enjoying the practice of problem solving. 

The code in this repo is pretty messy and there are probably much cleaner and more efficient solutions out there. 

In terms of puzzles completed, I would rank around the ***80th percentile of participants*** based on the following approximation. 
- 220K participants completed some portion of Day 1 
- 44K participants fully completed Day 14. 

The stars below indicate the number of correct answers on each day.

Looking forward to returning this in December 2022!
